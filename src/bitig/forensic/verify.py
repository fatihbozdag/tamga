"""Authorship verification — the General Impostors (GI) method.

Verification (one-class, same/different-author decision) is the forensically canonical task:
real case-work rarely offers a closed candidate set, so the question is not "which of N authors
wrote this?" but "did *this specific* candidate write it, or did someone else?".

The General Impostors method (Koppel & Winter 2014; Seidman 2013) answers this by repeatedly
sampling a random feature subspace and a random subset of "impostor" documents drawn from
authors other than the candidate, then asking: in that subspace, is the questioned document
closer to the candidate's known writing than to any of the impostors? The fraction of
iterations in which the candidate wins is the verification score.

class GeneralImpostors:
    """Authorship verification via the General Impostors method.

    Parameters
    ----------
    n_iterations : int
        Number of random feature-subspace + impostor-subsample iterations (Koppel & Winter
        2014 used 100; PAN baselines typically use 50-200).
    feature_subsample_rate : float
        Fraction of feature columns sampled per iteration, in (0, 1]. 0.5 is the classical
        default; smaller values increase variance but decorrelate impostor rankings.
    impostor_sample_size : int or None
        Number of impostors to sample per iteration. If None, uses
        ``ceil(sqrt(n_impostors))`` (a defensible default that scales sub-linearly with the
        pool size, so a large pool does not make every iteration trivially win).
    similarity : {"cosine", "minmax"}
        Similarity function used to compare the questioned document to the candidate and to
        each impostor.

        - ``cosine``: dot(u, v) / (||u|| * ||v||); works for any real-valued features.
        - ``minmax``: sum(min(u, v)) / sum(max(u, v)); Koppel et al.'s MinMax similarity,
          which requires non-negative features (e.g., raw relative frequencies). Raises if
          any feature in Q/known/impostors is negative.
    aggregate : {"centroid", "nearest"}
        How to build a single comparison point from the candidate's known documents:

        - ``centroid``: compare Q to the mean vector of the known samples (simple, standard).
        - ``nearest``: compare Q to the nearest known sample in the projected subspace
          (more conservative under stylistic heterogeneity within an author's corpus).
    seed : int
        Seed for the numpy random generator used to sample features and impostors.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from bitig.forensic import GeneralImpostors
    >>> gi = GeneralImpostors(n_iterations=100, seed=42)
    >>> result = gi.verify(questioned=q_fm, known=known_fm, impostors=pool_fm)
    >>> result.values["score"]    # fraction of iterations where known beat all impostors
