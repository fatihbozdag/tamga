"""Craig's Zeta — contrastive-vocabulary extraction between two author/group populations.

Classical Zeta (Burrows 2007; Craig & Kinney 2009):
    zeta(w) = proportion_A(w) - proportion_B(w)
where proportion_X(w) = (# documents in X containing w) / (# documents in X).

Eder's variant (Eder 2017) adds Laplace smoothing so zero-count words don't explode under the
logarithmic variants some authors use.
