# Features

Every feature extractor returns a `FeatureMatrix` — the shared numeric envelope that
methods consume.

## The FeatureMatrix

```python
@dataclass
class FeatureMatrix:
    X: np.ndarray            # (n_docs, n_features)
    document_ids: list[str]
    feature_names: list[str]
    feature_type: str
    extractor_config: dict[str, Any]
    provenance_hash: str
```

Key properties:

- `fm.n_features`, `len(fm)` for `n_docs`
- `fm.as_dataframe()` — pandas `DataFrame` indexed by `document_ids`
- `fm.concat(other)` — column-concatenate two matrices with identical row ids

### Extractor detail

Each extractor above is a callable object; `fit_transform(corpus)` returns a
`FeatureMatrix`.

#### MFWExtractor
`MFWExtractor(n=200, scale="zscore", lowercase=True)`

*Use when:* you want the canonical stylometric feature — relative frequencies of
the most-frequent words. Default choice for Delta-family attribution.
*Don't use when:* your corpus is very small (<200 unique tokens), or the question is
topic-invariant (MFW is topic-sensitive; see `CategorizedCharNgramExtractor`).
*Expect:* an `(n_docs, n)` float matrix; rows sum to ~1 under `scale="l1"`,
zero-centred unit-variance under `scale="zscore"`.

#### CharNgramExtractor
`CharNgramExtractor(n=3, include_boundaries=True)`

*Use when:* you want features that capture sub-word style (prefixes, suffixes,
punctuation adjacency) and that cope with OOV words or misspellings.
*Don't use when:* your languages mix scripts (n-grams across scripts produce noise),
or you specifically need word-level semantic sensitivity.
*Expect:* sparse count matrix delegated to sklearn's `CountVectorizer`.

#### WordNgramExtractor
`WordNgramExtractor(n=1, lowercase=True)`

*Use when:* unigrams (MFW equivalent) or short bigram phrases are what you need and
you don't want z-scoring. Bigrams useful for detecting fixed expressions.
*Don't use when:* n ≥ 3 in small corpora — sparsity dominates. Use `MFWExtractor`
for unigrams unless you need raw counts.
*Expect:* sparse count matrix; vocabulary grows fast with n.

#### PosNgramExtractor
`PosNgramExtractor(n=2, coarse=False)`

*Use when:* you want syntactic-style features (sequences of part-of-speech tags) —
insensitive to content words, sensitive to register and syntactic register.
*Don't use when:* your spaCy pipeline doesn't include a tagger (most `_trf` models
do), or your corpus is very small per-doc.
*Expect:* sparse count matrix over POS n-grams. `coarse=True` uses UD coarse tags
(fewer dimensions, more robust).

#### DependencyBigramExtractor
`DependencyBigramExtractor()`

*Use when:* you want syntax-sensitive style features — specifically, the
(head-lemma, dependency-relation, child-lemma) triples parsed by spaCy.
*Don't use when:* your parser is a bottleneck; dependency parsing is the slowest
step in the spaCy pipeline and you may be able to substitute POS n-grams.
*Expect:* sparse count matrix over dependency triples.

#### FunctionWordExtractor
`FunctionWordExtractor(wordlist=None)`

*Use when:* you want the short, topic-insensitive function-word list (the classic
anti-topic signal for stylometry) for the document's language.
*Don't use when:* your corpus mixes languages without a per-doc language tag — the
per-language word list won't apply.
*Expect:* `(n_docs, |wordlist|)` relative-frequency matrix. Defaults come from the
bundled per-language list (see [Languages](languages.md)).

#### PunctuationExtractor
`PunctuationExtractor()`

*Use when:* you want pure-style features that are nearly topic-invariant —
punctuation usage is remarkably author-specific and corpus-robust.
*Don't use when:* your source text has been normalised or stripped of punctuation
(e.g., OCR output without correction).
*Expect:* `(n_docs, ~20)` matrix of ASCII punctuation relative frequencies.

#### ReadabilityExtractor
`ReadabilityExtractor()`

*Use when:* you want readability-as-style — Flesch, FK-grade, Gunning Fog, etc. —
as a lightweight feature set to combine with MFW.
*Don't use when:* readability itself is the question (for that, read the metric
directly; don't bundle into a Delta). For non-English, use the per-language
native-formula variant — see `concepts/languages.md`.
*Expect:* `(n_docs, 6)` matrix of readability indices (English defaults: Flesch,
FK-grade, Gunning Fog, Coleman-Liau, ARI, SMOG).

#### SentenceLengthExtractor
`SentenceLengthExtractor()`

*Use when:* you want the sentence-rhythm signature — mean, SD, and skew of
per-sentence token counts. Small but strong stylistic signal.
*Don't use when:* your text has aggressive sentence-boundary errors (e.g., ALL
CAPS legal text breaks most sentencizers).
*Expect:* `(n_docs, 3)` matrix: `[mean, std, skew]`.

#### LexicalDiversityExtractor
`LexicalDiversityExtractor()`

*Use when:* you want vocabulary-richness features — TTR, MATTR, MTLD, HD-D, Yule's
K/I, Herdan's C, Simpson's D. Eight indices let you compare sensitivities.
*Don't use when:* your documents are very short (<200 tokens); most indices become
unstable.
*Expect:* `(n_docs, 8)` matrix; columns are the 8 indices.

#### SentenceEmbeddingExtractor
`SentenceEmbeddingExtractor(model="paraphrase-MiniLM-L6-v2")`

*Use when:* you want a modern neural-embedding feature set — pooled
sentence-transformer output per document. Strong in classification + clustering;
fast enough for moderate corpora.
*Don't use when:* your hardware lacks GPU / MPS and your corpus is large (CPU
inference is slow), or when interpretability matters (these vectors are opaque).
*Expect:* `(n_docs, embedding_dim)` dense matrix. Requires `tamga[embeddings]`.

#### ContextualEmbeddingExtractor
`ContextualEmbeddingExtractor(model="bert-base-multilingual-cased", pooling="mean")`

*Use when:* you want HuggingFace-model hidden states aggregated per document —
language-specific embeddings (e.g., `dbmdz/bert-base-turkish-cased` for Turkish)
with configurable pooling.
*Don't use when:* you don't need a specific model's representation — use
`SentenceEmbeddingExtractor` for a lighter, faster default.
*Expect:* `(n_docs, hidden_dim)` dense matrix. Requires `tamga[embeddings]`.

## Composing features

Two ways to build a multi-feature matrix:

### Python

```python
from tamga import MFWExtractor, PunctuationExtractor

mfw = MFWExtractor(n=200, scale="zscore").fit_transform(corpus)
punct = PunctuationExtractor().fit_transform(corpus)
combined = mfw.concat(punct)  # (n_docs, n_mfw + n_punct)
```

### study.yaml

```yaml
features:
  - id: mfw
    type: mfw
    n: 200
    scale: zscore
  - id: punct
    type: punctuation
```

Methods can reference feature ids; the runner builds each matrix once and reuses it.

## Forensic feature extractors

Two topic-invariant extractors live under `tamga.forensic`:

#### CategorizedCharNgramExtractor
`CategorizedCharNgramExtractor(n=4, categories=("prefix","suffix","punct"))`

*Use when:* you want topic-invariant character-level features for forensic
verification — n-grams classified by position in the word so you can keep only
the style-carrying categories (affixes, punctuation) and drop the topic-sensitive
whole-word category.
*Don't use when:* topic robustness isn't the goal — a plain `CharNgramExtractor`
is faster and carries more signal per dimension.
*Expect:* sparse count matrix restricted to the chosen n-gram categories.

Sapkota et al. 2015; `categories=("prefix","suffix","punct")` is the affix-only
recipe that generalises best across topics.

#### distort_corpus
`distort_corpus(corpus, mode="dv_ma")`

*Use when:* you want Stamatatos (2013) topic masking — replaces content words with
placeholders while keeping function words and punctuation. Pair with any
extractor for a topic-invariant pipeline.
*Don't use when:* your analysis needs content-word signal (e.g., Zeta looking for
distinctive vocabulary).
*Expect:* a new Corpus object you feed to any existing extractor. Modes: `"dv_ma"`
masks all content words, `"dv_sa"` masks selectively.

See [Topic-invariant features](../forensic/topic-invariance.md).

## Scaling

Most extractors accept `scale ∈ {"none", "zscore", "l1", "l2"}`:

- `none` — raw counts. Use for Bayesian Wallace–Mosteller.
- `l1` — relative frequencies (row sums to 1). Use for Zeta-like contrast methods.
- `l2` — unit-norm rows. Use for cosine-based distances.
- `zscore` — per-column z-score on training means / SDs (Stylo convention). **Required for
  Burrows Delta.**

The z-score mean / SD are learned at `fit` time and applied at `transform` — so scores on
unseen documents use the training distribution.
